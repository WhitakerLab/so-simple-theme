DELETE EVERYTHING BELOW THE LINE AFTER YOU'VE READ IT!

To create a new lab meeting blog post:

1. Make a copy of this file and save it in the `_posts/blog` directory with a name that follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-YYYY-MM-DD-labmeeting.md`
  * For example: `_posts/blog/2017-04-28-2017-04-28-lab-meeting.md`
  * You need the DOUBLE DATE because the first date gets stripped from the url, so if you want the date to appear you need to enter it twice!
2. In your new file update the header information:
  * Update the title by replacing "DATE" on line 3 with the date
  * [OPTIONAL] Add tags by adding them inside the square brackets above and separating with commas, or just keep the default,
    * Eg: `[lab-meeting, open-humans]`
  * Update the date with today's date (or the date you want the post to go live) by replacing the date on line 9.
    * Double check that this is the same date as in the heading.
    * Make sure that the date is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  * Change the author if you aren't `kirstie_whitaker` :wink:

3. Write the blog post! You can use markdown to format the text. Check out this handy dandy [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [adam-p](https://github.com/adam-p).
  * You can follow the headings outlined above, or make up your own.
  * Pictures are really good. Make a subfolder in the `images` folder and add them there.
