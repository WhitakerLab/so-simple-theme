# Welcome!

This is my first lab blog post. It really only functions as a test to see if I could figure out the jekyll integration.

*Update: turns out I can! :raised_hands:*

But since you're here, why don't you watch this beautiful video of [Greg Dunn's](http://www.gregadunn.com/) [Self Reflected](http://www.gregadunn.com/self-reflected/) brain installation at the [Franklin Institute](https://www.fi.edu/) in Philadelphia, PA :smile:.
