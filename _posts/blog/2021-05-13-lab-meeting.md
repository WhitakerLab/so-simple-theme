# Lab Meeting on 13th March 2021

This week's lab meeting focused on **Sarah** running us through building a blog with Hugo and GitHub pages.
This was part of Sarah's wonderful efforts to update the Whitaker Lab blog to a new layout and ensure our updates are going out regularly.
Sarah did a tour de force through her instructions for setting up a blog using Hugo anfd GitHub pages from scratch. 
If you are interested in setting up your own blog, Sarah's instructions are available on her own blog as a [Carpentries style lesson](https://sgibson91.github.io/blogging-with-hugo-and-github-pages/).

# Celebrations and cool things to share
The week for most lab members was about getting many smaller tasks done while taking care of yourself.

**Arielle** helped by mentoring contributors.   
**Laura** made good progress on her PhD chapter and sent that off to her supervisors.

**Lotty** facilitated her first AutSPACEs meet up.  

## Recommendations for movies and reading
