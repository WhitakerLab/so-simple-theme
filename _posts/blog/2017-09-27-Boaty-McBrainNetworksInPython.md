The Whitaker Lab has been working on some code currently known as [BrainNetworksInPython](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython) with the intention to release it as a python package. We'd like to conform to the naming conventions given by [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names):
>Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

We need a new name: short(ish), all lower case and ideally relevant to what BrainNetworksInPython [does](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython/blob/master/README.md).  
If you have ideas or good taste go forth and [vote](https://poll.ly/#/Gx4yMMY7)!
