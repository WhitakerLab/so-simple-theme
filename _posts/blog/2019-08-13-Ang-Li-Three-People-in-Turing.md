Some amazing people I met in Turing. :)

## Bo Wang

Bo Wang is a visiting researcher at Turing and work with Professor Terry Lyons based at Oxford. 
I knew him because he is one of the organizers for Data science for mental health, an interest group aiming
to lead to suitable clinical interventions for mental health by using multi-modal data. Bo is interested in 
developing a clinically useful application for mental health through his expert in deep learning. He’s also working 
on some other projects. One project he’s working on is to analyze speech signals of individuals with mental 
disorders and try to help identify early high risk individuals and aid the diagnosis processing in
psychiatry. He believes the key of such success could benefit more from novel methods integrated with prior 
knowledge and correct data, and we could not only rely on the magic of AI. He’s very helpful and helped me 
with establishing the azure server and applying for credits, which is crucial for my work in the Turing. Bo may 
come back to China one day and it would be exciting if I can collaborate with him on some project in the future. 

## Alex Campbell
Alex Campbell is an enrichment student at Turing and a PhD candidate at University of Cambridge. During his Master's 
period, Alex used deep learning technology in financial data mining and then he switched his main interest to
brain science and mental disorders. Kirstie introduced Alex to me as he is also worked on projects using neuroimaging 
data. One of his interests is to apply advanced AI models to data of human brain. Alex shared his recent work with me, 
where he used sophisticated machine learning model on a large-sample fMRI dataset to derive pathological brain circuits 
in autism. Alex is very helpful and really an expert at deep learnig models. He suggested me that I could use Siamese 
network to index maturity in my project, which is very useful. 

## Anujan Poologaindran

Anujan Poologaindran was a neurosurgeon in Canada and worked on a magic surgery for treatment-resistant depression 
patients. His work is very meaningful and helps many depressive patients to start a new life without the risk of 
suicide. However, some of the patients tend to respond more to this surgery, which motiviated Anujan to further 
investigate this heterogeneity and thus pursue a PhD degree at University of Cambridge. He's project here is pretty 
cool and aims to identify the depression patients who would be most likely to respond to this surgery and find the 
optimal surgery target for each individual, involving neurosurgery, neuroimaging and machine learning. He also 
believes that the curcuit of this surgery targets is a transdiagnostic biomarker, and thus it could be useful to apply 
this surgery to all patients who have strong suicidal urges. I really love his ideas and hope he can move this 
promising field forward and help with more patients.
