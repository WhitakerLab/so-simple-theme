I was invited to discuss the "reproducibility crisis" for BBC Newshour Extra on the World Service.

The other panel members were [Brian Nosek](https://twitter.com/BrianNosek), [Jeff Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek), [DaniÃ«l Lakens](https://twitter.com/lakens) and [Chris Graf](https://twitter.com/chrisgrafpub). Give them all a follow on twitter, they're awesome people!

The one hour discussion is available at the [BBC Newshour Extra site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p051b9zg) and you can download the podcast from there to listen offline.

Let me know what you think!
