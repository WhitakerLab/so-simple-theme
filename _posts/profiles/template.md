To create a WhitakerLab bio for yourself:
1. If you haven't already, create an author profile for yourself in the `_data/authors.yml` file
2. Make a copy of this file and save it in the `_posts/profile` directory with a name that follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`
  * For example: `_posts/profile/2018-01-02-Isla-Staden.md`
3. In your new file update the header information:
  * Update the title by replacing "INSERT TITLE" on line 3 with the title
  * Add an excerpt if you'd like. This will be seen on the profile landing page or the search page. Try to keep the excerpt only one short sentence long.
  * Update the date with today's date (or the date you want the post to go live) by replacing the date on line 9.
  * Update the author by replacing `billy_rick` with the name of your own author profile

4. Write your profile! You can use markdown to format the text. Check out this handy dandy [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [adam-p](https://github.com/adam-p).  
  Suggested content:
  * photo - the photo attached to your author profile will automatically be included. If you want you can delete the author field and add a different photo, or have more than one etc. If you're feeling bold you can add your picture as a feature image.
