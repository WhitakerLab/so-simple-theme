# Whitaker Lab Website

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io)
 
This repository contains the code to host the Whitaker Lab website: https://whitakerlab.github.io.

It is powered by Jekyll and based off the [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme) by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com). THANK YOU Michael :tada: :sparkles:

Continuous integration is managed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). If our build status badge (at the top of this page) is not a beautiful bright green, please take a look and see if you can fix any of the problems!

## Some useful commands

I ([Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane)) find myself googling for the following commands everytime I interact with this repository, so here they are to make my life easier!

* [Setting up your github pages site locally with jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)<br/>
      Specifically I want the following command from [step 4](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site) which builds the website locally<br/>
      
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
