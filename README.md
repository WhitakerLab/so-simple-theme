# Whitaker Lab Website

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-web)
 
This repository contains the code to host the Whitaker Lab website: https://whitakerlab.github.io.

It is powered by Jekyll and based off the [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme) by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com). THANK YOU Michael :tada: :sparkles:

Continuous integration is managed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). If our build status badge (at the top of this page) is not a beautiful bright green, please take a look and see if you can fix any of the problems!
