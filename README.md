# Whitaker Lab Website

[TBA: Build Status Badge]

This repository contains the code to host the Whitaker Lab website: <https://whitakerlab.github.io>.

It is powered by Hugo and based off the [Minimo Theme](https://minimo.netlify.app/)

Continuous integration is managed by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
If our build status badge (at the top of this page) is not a beautiful bright green, please take a look and see if you can fix any of the problems!

## Some useful commands

I ([Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane)) find myself googling for the following commands everytime I interact with this repository, so here they are to make my life easier!

* [Hugo Getting Started quickstart guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)<br/>
      Specifically I want the following command from [step 5](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-5-start-the-hugo-server) which builds the website locally, including any posts marked as draft<br/>

```bash
hugo server -D
```
