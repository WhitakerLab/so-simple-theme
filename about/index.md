<img src="/images/KW_OpenCon2016_Square.jpg" alt="Kirstie Whitaker" width="50%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">

Kirstie Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK).
She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia.
She joined the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge in 2012 and conducted her postdoctoral research in the Brain Mapping Unit under the supervision of Professor Ed Bullmore.
She remains a member of the department as a senior research associate.

Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions.
Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues.
She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.

Dr Whitaker is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
She was chair of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping's Open Science special interest group in 2019 and served on the committee as chair-elect in 2018 and past chair in 2020.
She is founding chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group and member of the Tools, Practices and Systems leadership team.
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

Her role in the Whitaker lab is to shepherd the incredible team, to build connections to help them work collaboratively and inclusively to efficiently achieve their goals.
In her spare time [she tweets](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j) (a lot) and hangs out with her dog [in Greenwich Park](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1186900239531331585?s=20) or with her family [in the Lake District](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1215696702826397696?s=20).
